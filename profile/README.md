## Hills dream

We became an expert in remote work. Many of our customers are remote, having team distributed in multiple office helps us to practice and remove the challenges our customers can face by being remote. 

Working in hills has opened the door to a new era of freedom and luxury. This is not just theory of us. Over the past six years, weâ€™ve grown a successful software company in hills.

[Our hill story](https://coloredcow.com/category/hill-story/) is bit different from working remote: We wanted to avoid the disadvantage of city life and wanted meaningful work and meaning in our work


## Story Club

We give a lot of importance to communication and doing it well. Being able to express who we are, what we stand for, and effectively collaborate with people from different backgrounds and cultures. With this spirit, we launched our Story Club where each team member comes forward to present their story and experiences to the rest of the team, every week. Visit our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVCPQ-ZKNgs&list=PLn1_vUUOj6IG5l5As7A2ESrRRvb9QkSeY) to know more about this initiative.
